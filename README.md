# Task Tracker challenge

Starter project for a task-tracker challenge for you to show off your kick-ass frontend skills and get to know Vue, Typescript, etc.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Get started
A Vue project is already set up, using Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

A few skeleton components are provided with a load of @todos to get stuck into.

Where you start is up to you!
